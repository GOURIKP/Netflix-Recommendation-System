# Netfilx-Recommandation-System
This project aims to replicate the recommendation system used by Netflix to personalize the content catalogue for its users. The recommendation system utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict and suggest movies and TV shows tailored to each user's preferences.

# Key Features:
Personalized Recommendations: The system analyzes the user's viewing history, ratings, and interactions with the platform to generate personalized recommendations.

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend content based on the behavior of similar users.

Content-based Filtering: Considers attributes such as genre, category, and description of movies and TV shows to recommend similar content.

Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability as the user base grows.

# Technologies Used:
Python,Pandas,NumPy,SciPy,Scikit-learn

# Usage:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for modeling.

Model Training: Train machine learning models using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical representations for similarity computation.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between movies based on their descriptions and genres.

Recommendation Generation: Provides personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a service or integrate it into a web application for real-time recommendations.
