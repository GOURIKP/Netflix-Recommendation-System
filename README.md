# Netfilx-Recommandation-System
This project aims to replicate the recommendation system used by Netflix to personalize the content catalogue for its users. The recommendation system utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict and suggest movies and TV shows tailored to each user's preferences.

# Key Features:
Personalized Recommendations: The system analyzes the user's viewing history, ratings, and interactions with the platform to generate personalized recommendations.

Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to recommend content based on the behavior of similar users.

Content-based Filtering: Considers attributes such as genre, category, and description of movies and TV shows to recommend similar content.

Matrix Factorization: Implements matrix factorization algorithms such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to uncover latent factors and improve recommendation accuracy.

Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability as the user base grows.

# Technologies Used:
Python,Pandas,NumPy,SciPy,Scikit-learn

# Usage:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for modeling.

Model Training: Train machine learning models using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Precision@k and Recall@k.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a service or integrate it into a web application for real-time recommendations.
